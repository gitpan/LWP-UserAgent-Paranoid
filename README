NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid - A modern LWPx::ParanoidAgent for safer
    requests

SYNOPSIS
        use LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid;
        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid->new(
            request_timeout => 5   # seconds
        );

        # use $ua as a normal LWP::UserAgent...
        my $response = $ua->get("http://example.com");

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a more modern LWPx::ParanoidAgent with cleaner internals
    and a very similar feature set. It is a not a drop-in replacement,
    however, since the API differs.

    The primary features provided by this module:

  Overall request timeout
    A configurable timeout from start to finish of a "logical" request made
    by calling one of LWP::UserAgent's request methods. It encompasses all
    followed redirects to ensure that you can't be tarpitted by a series of
    stalling redirects. The default is 5 seconds.

  Blocked private hosts and IP address ranges
    All new agents are automatically made paranoid of private hostnames and
    IP address ranges using LWPx::ParanoidHandler. You may access the
    Net::DNS::Paranoid resolver via the "resolver" method in order to
    customize the blocked or whitelisted hosts.

EVEN MORE PARANOIA
    You may also wish to tune standard LWP::UserAgent parameters for greater
    paranoria depending on your requirements:

  Maximum number of redirects
    Although generally unnecessary given the request timeout, you can tune
    "max_redirects" in LWP::UserAgent down from the default of 7.

  Protocols/URI schemes allowed
    If you don't want to allow requests for schemes other than http and
    https, you may use "protocols_allowed" in LWP::UserAgent either as a
    method or as an option to *new*.

        $ua->protocols_allowed(["http", "https"]);

WHY NOT LWPx::ParanoidAgent?
    LWPx::ParanoidAgent's implemention involves a 2009-era fork of LWP's
    http and https protocol handlers, and it is no longer maintained. A more
    maintainable approach is taken by this module and LWPx::ParanoidHandler.

METHODS
    All methods from LWP::UserAgent are available via inheritence. In
    addition, the following methods are available:

  request_timeout
    Gets/sets the timeout which encapsulates each logical request, including
    any redirects which are followed. The default is 5 seconds.

  resolver
    Gets/sets the DNS resolver which is used to block private hosts. There
    is little need to set your own but if you do it should be an
    Net::DNS::Paranoid object.

    Use the blocking and whitelisting methods on the resolver to customize
    the behaviour.
